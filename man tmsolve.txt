.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
 The Terminal calculator has currently 6 modes:
 - Scientific.
 - Function.
 - Matrix.
 - Equation.
 - Complex.
 - Utility.
.SH Accessing the modes:
When the calculator launches without command line options, it asks for the mode to use. Enter the letter matching the mode and press the enter key. To exit back to the main menu, type exit. Typing exit in the main menu will close the calculator. 
.SH Command line options:

.SH Scientific mode:
.P
 The default mode used by the calculator.

 Syntax of the scientific mode:
 - Basic operators supported: +, -, *, /, %, ^,!
 - Parenthesis support ().
 - Derivation on one variable using "d/dx(f(x))(x0)".
 - Integration support using "int(a;b)(f(x))".
 - Trigonometry functions: sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan().
 - Hyperbolic functions: sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), asinh(), acosh(), atanh().
 - Logarithms using ln() for base e, and log() for base 10.
 - Absolute value using abs().
 - Rouding functions: ceil() and floor().
 - Supports complex input and will solve the expression using the complex interpreter (read more below).

.SH Notes:
.P
 - Priority of operations from higher to lower (operators in square brakets have the same priority): () ! ^ [ * / % ] [ + - ]
 - Implicit multiplication fully supported.
 - Trigonometric functions uses radians as the angle unit.
 - When possible, the calculator will try to show the results as fraction.
 - The calculator accepts input in C style scientific representation (example: 1.36e-4 which means 1.36*10^-4, same behavior with 'E')
   and will output values in this form when the numbers get too big or too small.
 - You can use the pi and exponential constants by typing pi or exp.
 - You can use the previous answer by typing ans (ans resets to 0 when the calculator closes).
 - This mode outputs numbers with 12-digit precision.
 - You can use spaces in the input to improve readability.
 - The same input rules of this mode are used in Function, Matrix and Equation mode.

.SH Function mode:
.P
 - It prompts for the function: f(x)= ...; make sure to enter lowercase x as the variable because it is case sensitive,
   follows same rules as scientific mode, but without derivation and integration support.
 - Next, enter the value to start from, the value to end at, the step between each output and the stepping method (supports +, *, ^).
 The stepping method must be specified directly after the end of the step value (example:5*,3^,7+), if not specified, defaults to +.
.P
.B Stepping method:
 The stepping method shows how the value replacing 'x' will change with each run,
 for example using 5* will multiply the value beginning from the start by 5 with each run.
 Same with 3^, which will raise the value beginning from the start to power 3 with each run.

.SH Matrix mode:
.P
 There are 6 matrixes in this mode: A, B, C, D, E, R.
 R stores the results of the previous operation if it outputs a matrix.

.SH List of operations:
.P
 - editX: Edits the specified matrix.
 - multiplyXY: Executes the matrix multiplication X*Y.
 - copyXY: Copies the matrix X into the matrix Y.
 - comX: Calculates the comatrix and prints the result.
 - invX: Calculates the inverse and prints the result.
 - detX: Finds the determinant.
 - trX: Find the transpose of a matrix.
 - printX: Prints the specified matrix.
 - exit: Returns to main menu.
 All matrixes are erased upon closing of the calculator or exiting of the matrix mode.

.SH Equation mode:
.P
 Features:
 - Linear equation system of first degree with n equations (type Sn with n: number of unknowns).
 - Linear equation of degree up and including 3 (type En with n: degree).
 After finding the results, the calculator will print the equation/system and the results.

.SH Complex mode:
.P
 - Basic operators supported: +, -, *, /, ^
 - Parenthesis support ().
 - Implicit multiplication fully supported.
 - Support of the following complex functions:
 - Modulus: abs(), argument: arg()
 - Trigonometric functions: cos(), sin(), tan(), acos(), asin(), atan()
 - Hyperbolic functions: cosh(), sinh(), tanh(), acosh(), asinh(), atanh()
 - Complex logarithm (base e): log()
 - Scientific notation (same as in scientific mode).
 - The same syntax of this mode can be used in scientific mode, but it is better to use this mode if you are sure that you want to do complex arithmetic.

.SH Notes:
.P
 - This mode prints the results in the form a + ib and prints the modulus and argument (in radians, pi radians, and degrees).
 - Priority of operations from higher to lower (operators in square brakets have the same priority): () ^ [ * / ] [ + - ]

.SH Utility mode:
.P
 Features:
 - Factorization of numbers, simply enter an integral number and you will get the factors.
 - Root solving, must be entered in format (n)\|value (n is the root power, example (3)\|27 = 3) or simply \|value if you want square root.
 - Conversion of decimal to fraction, will output a fraction if the conversion succeeds.
 - Reduction of a fraction of format value1/value2 .
.SH Note: All values in this mode must be in range (-2 147 483 647;2 147 483 647).
