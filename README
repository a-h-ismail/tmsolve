Name:
-----
Terminal math solver (tmsolve). Powerful and efficient console calculator.

Modes:
------
tmsolve has currently 6 modes:
- Scientific.
- Function.
- Matrix.
- Equation.
- Complex.
- Utility.

Command line options:
--------------------
Usage: tmsolve [options]

[expression] : Calculates the expression, prints the result to stdout and exits.
-s : Scientific mode
-f : Function mode
-m : Matrix mode
-e : Equation mode
-c : Complex mode
-u : Utility mode

Scientific mode:
----------------
The default mode used by the calculator, supports expressions as long as 250 characters.

Syntax of the scientific mode:
- Basic operators supported: +, -, *, /, %, ^,!
- Parenthesis support ().
- Derivation on one variable using "d/dx(f(x))(x0)".
- Integration support using "int(a;b)(f(x))".
- Trigonometry functions: sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan().
- Hyperbolic functions: sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), asinh(), acosh(), atanh().
- Logarithms using ln() for base e, and log() for base 10.
- Absolute value using abs().
- Rouding functions: ceil() and floor().
- Supports complex input and will solve the expression using the complex interpreter (read more below).

Notes:
------
- Priority of operations from higher to lower (operators in square brakets have the same priority): () ! ^ [ * / % ] [ + - ]
- Implicit multiplication is not allowed due to possible confusion related to its priotity compared to *,/ operators.
- Trigonometric functions uses radians as the angle unit.
- When possible, the calculator will try to show the results as fraction.
- The calculator accepts input in C style scientific representation (example: 1.36e-4 which means 1.36*10^-4, same behavior with 'E')
  and will output values in this form when the numbers get too big or too small.
- You can use the pi and exponential constants by typing pi or exp.
- You can use the previous answer by typing ans (ans resets to 0 when the calculator closes).
- This mode outputs numbers with 14-digit precision.
- You can use spaces in the input to improve readability.
- The same input rules of this mode are used in Function, Matrix and Equation mode.

Function mode:
--------------
This mode can be accessed by entering 'F' in the main menu.
- It prompts for the function: f(x)= ...; make sure to enter lowercase x as the variable because it is case sensitive.
- Next, enter the value to start from, the value to end at, the step between each output and the stepping method (supports +, *, ^).
The stepping method must be specified directly after the end of the step value (example:5*,3^,7+), if not specified, defaults to +.
Stepping method:
 The stepping method shows how the value replacing 'x' will change with each run, for example using 5* will multiply the value beginning from the start by 5 with each run. Same with 3^, which will raise the value beginning from the start to power 3 with each run.

Matrix mode:
------------
There are 6 matrixes in this mode: A, B, C, D, E, R.
R stores the results of the previous operation if it outputs a matrix.

List of operations:
- editX: Edits the specified matrix.
- multiplyXY: Executes the matrix multiplication X*Y.
- copyXY: Copies the matrix X into the matrix Y.
- comX: Calculates the comatrix and prints the result.
- invX: Calculates the inverse and prints the result.
- detX: Finds the determinant.
- trX: Find the transpose of a matrix.
- printX: Prints the specified matrix.
- exit: Returns to main menu.
Note: All matrixes are erased upon closing of the calculator or exiting of the matrix mode.

Equation mode:
--------------
This mode can be accessed by entering 'E' in the main menu.
Supported features:
- Linear equation system of first degree with n equations (type Sn with n: number of unknowns).
- Linear equation of degree up and including 3 (type En with n: degree).
After finding the results, the calculator will print the equation/system and the results.

Complex mode:
-------------
This mode can be accessed by entering 'C' in the main menu.
Syntax of complex mode:
- Basic operators supported: +, -, *, /, ^
- Parenthesis support ().
- Support of the following complex functions:
- Modulus: abs(), argument: arg()
- Trigonometric functions: cos(), sin(), tan(), acos(), asin(), atan()
- Hyperbolic functions: cosh(), sinh(), tanh(), acosh(), asinh(), atanh()
- Complex logarithm (base e): log()
- Scientific notation (same as in scientific mode).

Notes:
- This mode prints the results in the form a + ib and prints the modulus and argument (in radians and degrees).
- Priority of operations from higher to lower (operators in square brakets have the same priority): () ^ [ * / ] [ + - ]

Utility mode:
-----------
This mode can be accessed by entering 'U' in the main menu.
Features:
- Factorization of numbers, simply enter an integral number and you will get the factors.
- Root solving, must be entered in format (n)\|value (n is the root power, example (3)\|27 = 3) or simply \|value if you want square root.
- Conversion of decimal to fraction, will output a fraction if the conversion succeeds.
- Reduction of a fraction of format value1/value2 .
Note: All values in this mode must be in range (-2 147 483 647;2 147 483 647).
